# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xavi Grandes and I coded this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

I build an interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users are able to:

- View the rating state layout for mobile and desktop.
- Select a number to submit
- Submit a number rating
- View the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## Technologies

- Html
- Css (BEM methodology "Block Element Modifier")
- Javascript
